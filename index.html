              <p>Tetragon was founded by a small team of publishers and web developers who wanted to bring pre-press services back to the UK, using custom-built software to keep costs down.</p>

              <p>We're <a href="/contact">based in London</a> and currently work with <a href="/clients">a number of small to medium-sized publishers</a> and book shops, for whom we provide <a href="/publishing-services">services</a> that include typesetting, creating hand-crafted eBooks, editing from a multi-lingual British team, proofreading and e-newsletters that reach tens of thousands of people daily.</p>
              <p>We try to streamline all our processes so our team knows your book and style intimately, and that everything from copy-editing to eBook design is consistent and done under one roof.</p>
