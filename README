TO DEPLOY:
normally you'd publish the Jekyll source to github and it'd compile it silently there, but we're using some plugins (jekyll-archive, for the blog)
which aren't compatible, so we need to push the compiled _site dir (which is overwritten with every compile) to github instead.
see http://ixti.net/software/2013/01/28/using-jekyll-plugins-on-github-pages.html

I created Rakefile here and just deploy with
	rake publish
- it basically copies the stuff to a temp directory and uplaods

BUT you need to go back into the git hub repo and tell it you're using a custom domain with every deploy... kind of annoying

TO TEST LOCALLY:

in Sites/tetragonpublishing folder
	bundle exec jekyll serve
then check localhost:4000 on browser
