TO DEPLOY:
normally you'd publish the Jekyll source to github and it'd compile it silently there, but we're using some plugins (jekyll-archive, for the blog)
which aren't compatible, so we need to push the compiled _site dir (which is overwritten with every compile) to github instead.
see http://ixti.net/software/2013/01/28/using-jekyll-plugins-on-github-pages.html


TO TEST LOCALLY:

in Sites/tetragonpublishing folder
	bundle exec jekyll serve
then check localhost:4000 on browser
