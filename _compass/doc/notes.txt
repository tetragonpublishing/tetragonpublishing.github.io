drop-caps
=========
Had a nightmare trying to figure out why slightly different versions of Chrome (on PC and Mac) were showing dropcaps differently
- because it was using a slightly different, OTF version of the font local to the Mac. AAARRGH 
- I added a webkit fix, based on http://www.webmonkey.com/2010/02/browser-specific_css_hacks/

// hack for Webkit dropcaps, which are 10px below the others for some reason:
@media screen and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio:0) {
   margin: -2px 3px -15px 0;
}


Webkit seems to vertically centre (based on the line-height) on the cap X
Gecko does that for the lower-case X

For Georgia, they seem OK though

sprites
=======

- Using Compass and ID to generate them
- Using ID, create a doc with the elements you want in, then rasterise text, group any elements together as necessary,
 select all, object export settings, export as 72 DPI PNG, export to ePub, unzip ePub, take files, put them in 

 /sprites
 
then
  @import "compass/utilities"; 
  @import "icon/*.png"; 
  @include all-icon-sprites; 

see http://compass-style.org/help/tutorials/spriting/
http://www.viget.com/inspire/stop-making-sprites-compass-sass-and-png-sprite-generation/

We're using the new v.0.12 (RC1) of Compass, which allows for:
  generated_images_dir = "htdocs/img/spr";
  sprite_load_path = "sprites/"
so we can separate separate images and the compiled ones, which will go into the "spr" folder.

also see media tips: 
  @media paged {
    height: 100%;
    overflow: paged-x;
  }
  <link rel="next" href="p2.htm">
  @navigation {
    nav-right: link-rel(next);
  }

also book-like spread display (called CSS shaders)
  img {
    filter: custom(url(foo.fs), 20 20, phase 90);
  }
  
  and VARIABLES!!! @var $test = #f00;
