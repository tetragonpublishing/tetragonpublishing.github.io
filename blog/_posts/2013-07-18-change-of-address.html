	<p>
	I'm delighted to announce that Tetragon has recently been accepted as a member of the <a href="http://camdencollective.co.uk/">Camden Collective</a>, a hub for the arts in Camden. Our new address will be 37 Camden High Street, London NW1 7JE. It's a short walk from home, there's a ping-pong table and it's pretty much<!--more--> opposite <a href="https://twitter.com/LeyasCoffee">Leya's</a> &ndash; what more could you ask for? If you'd like to drop by and say hello, <a href="http://tetragonpublishing.com/contact">get in touch</a>. I'm hoping to expand the list of illustrators, copy-editors and proofreaders we work with in the near future.</p>
